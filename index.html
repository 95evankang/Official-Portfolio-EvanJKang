									<h2><a >About Me<br />
									</a></h2>
									<p>I'm currently an emerging professional, studying Software Development at Seattle Central College through the Year Up Program. Throughout my professional career, my passion has always involved food and hospitality. I was previously a part of Mary's Place Shelter in SLU working as a Kitchen Producer. The gift of exposing my guests to new and wonderful flavors is why I loved working with food. Community, Continuous Learning, and Fun are values that I want to bring to the table.</p>
